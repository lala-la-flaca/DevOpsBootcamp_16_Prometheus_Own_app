This exercise is part of Module 16 from the TWN DevOps Bootcamp. In Module 16, we learn how to monitor applications and infrastructure with Prometheus. This module covers everything from installing the Prometheus and Grafana stack on Kubernetes to setting up alerting and visual dashboards. We also learn how to monitor third-party apps such as Redis and collect custom metrics from your own applications. By the end of this module, you know how to build a complete monitoring solution that detects issues early, sends alerts, and visualizes performance data in real time.
